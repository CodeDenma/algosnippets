# AlgoSnippets README

AlgoSnippets provide convenient shortcuts when you're solving DS & A problems in
VS Code.

## Features

This extension features multiple shortcuts I found when working on algorithm
problems. To name a few...

1. lci: LeetCode Module Import
2. lcp: LeetCode Print
3. c: Complexity Analysis

> More shortcuts will be added soon!

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project
workspace:

## Known Issues

Currently AlgoSnippets is only supported in Python3. I am planning to add
snippets for other programming languages in the future.
